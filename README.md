# devops_sentry_risk_assessor - Intelligent DevOps Sentry (Risk Assessor)

Version: 0.1.0 (from agent_core/_version.py)
Date: 2025-05-21 22:31:24 EDT

The Intelligent DevOps Sentry (Risk Assessor component) is an agentic platform designed to help developers code, configure, deploy, and monitor systems more safely and efficiently. This component focuses on pre-deployment risk assessment.

**This project was bootstrapped using `setupProject-python-devops_sentry_risk_assessor-v1.sh`**

## 1. Project Overview & Philosophy

**The Problem:** Deploying software, especially in complex enterprise environments, is fraught with risk. Misconfigurations, subtle code bugs, incompatible dependencies, or overlooked security vulnerabilities can lead to outages, data breaches, or costly rollbacks. Existing CI/CD pipelines automate execution but often lack deep, semantic understanding of the changes being deployed.

**Our Solution (The "Intelligent DevOps Sentry" Vision):** An AI-powered agent that acts as a vigilant sentry throughout the DevOps lifecycle. This specific component, the **Pre-Flight Check & Risk Assessor**, is the first line of defense.

**Mechanic & Philosopher's View for an 8th Grader:**
Imagine you're about to launch a super important, very complicated rocket (your software deployment).
* **The Old Way:** You have a checklist, and maybe some automated tools that check *some* things (like if all the bolts are tightened â€“ basic CI checks). But they don't really *understand* if a new type of fuel you're using might react badly with the engine's lining under launch pressure.
* **The DevOps Sentry (Risk Assessor):** This is like having a genius rocket scientist *and* a super-experienced mechanic (our AI agent) who, before you even press the launch button, looks at your new fuel formula (code changes), the new engine parts you've designed (IaC changes), and the weather forecast (target environment state). They don't just look at the surface; they understand the *chemistry* and *physics* involved. They can say, "Hold on! This new fuel (code) combined with that engine part (config) on a cold day (environment) has a 70% chance of causing a misfire (deployment failure or bug) because of X, Y, and Z. You should adjust the fuel mixture (fix the code/config like this) first."
    Philosophically, it's about moving from mere "rule-following" to "understanding and foresight." The agent tries to comprehend the *essence* of the changes and their potential *consequences*, rather than just checking boxes. It aims for a "safer flight" by anticipating turbulence.

*Note: A PNG version of this diagram is not auto-generated by this AI. This ASCII diagram provides the conceptual flow.*

**Components:**
-   **Sentry CLI (`sentry_cli.py`):** User interface for triggering analysis.
-   **Risk Assessment Engine (`agent_core/risk_assessment_engine.py` - *to be created*):** Orchestrates the analysis process.
-   **Analyzers (`agent_core/analyzers/`):** Modular components specializing in different input types:
    -   : Analyzes source code changes (e.g., for bugs, anti-patterns, security issues).
    -   : Analyzes Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation for misconfigurations, security gaps).
    -   : Analyzes CI/CD pipeline definitions or deployment scripts.
-   **Risk Aggregator & Prioritizer:** Part of the engine; combines findings from analyzers and scores/prioritizes risks.
-   **Reporters (`agent_core/reporters/`):** Formats and outputs the risk assessment (e.g., console, JSON, HTML).
-   **Configuration (`config/`):** Rules, thresholds, LLM model endpoints, API keys (managed securely).

## 3. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   `pip` (Python package installer)
-   `bash` (for running the setup script)
-   (Optional but Recommended) Git for version control of your project and the agent's code.
-   (Potentially) Access to LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude) if analyzers use them. API keys would need to be configured securely (see Configuration section).
-   (Potentially) AWS CLI, Terraform CLI, etc., if analyzers need to interact with these tools to gather context.

## 4. Setup Instructions

**4.1. Navigate to Project Directory**
After running the `setupProject-...` script, a directory named `devops_sentry_risk_assessor` will be created. Navigate into it:
```bash
cd devops_sentry_risk_assessor
```

**4.2. Create and Activate Python Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended)**
```bash
# From the project root directory (devops_sentry_risk_assessor)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate:
# Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (Git Bash):
source .venv/Scripts/activate
# Windows (Command Prompt):
# .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows (PowerShell):
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
*Assumption: User will adapt activation for their specific shell if not listed or if using a different Windows terminal.*

**4.3. Install Dependencies**
Once the virtual environment is active:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4.4. Install the CLI Tool (Editable Mode for Development)**
This makes the `sentry-cli` command available while you develop:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

**4.5. Configuration (Conceptual)**
-   Create a configuration file (e.g., `config/agent_config.yaml`) or set environment variables for:
    -   LLM API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) - **DO NOT COMMIT KEYS TO GIT!** Use `.env` files (add `.env` to `.gitignore`) and a library like `python-dotenv`, or use a secrets manager.
    -   Paths to analysis rule sets.
    -   Default severity thresholds.
-   Example `.env` file (add to `.gitignore`):
    ```
    # .env
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    # GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    ```
*Assumption: The agent will include logic to load configurations from files or environment variables. This setup script does not create a default config file, as its content would be highly specific.*

## 5. Build Process

This project is Python-based. No separate build process (like compilation) is typically required beyond installing dependencies. Packaging for distribution would use `setup.py`.

## 6. Running the Application (Using the CLI)

After installation (`pip install -e .`), the `sentry-cli` command should be available.
```bash
# Display help
sentry-cli --help
sentry-cli analyze --help

# Example: Analyze a code path (assuming you have code in ../my_app_code)
# sentry-cli analyze --code-path ../my_app_code

# Example: Analyze IaC files (assuming you have IaC in ../my_infra_code)
# sentry-cli analyze --iac-path ../my_infra_code --output-format json
```
*Note: The actual analysis logic within `sentry_cli.py` and the `agent_core` is currently placeholder in this initial setup. You will need to implement the risk assessment engine and analyzers.*

## 7. Testing Procedures (Conceptual for MVP)

*Assumption: Formal automated tests are to be developed. This section outlines the strategy.*

-   **Unit Tests (`tests/unit`):**
    -   Use `pytest`.
    -   Test individual analyzer logic (e.g., does the IaC analyzer correctly identify an open S3 bucket from a sample Terraform file?).
    -   Mock LLM calls to test analyzer logic without actual API calls during unit tests.
    -   Test configuration loading, reporter formatting.
-   **Integration Tests (`tests/integration`):**
    -   Test the CLI command execution using `click.testing.CliRunner`.
    -   Test the flow from CLI input -> engine -> analyzer(s) -> reporter.
    -   May involve small, self-contained example code/IaC files as test fixtures.
-   **Running Tests (Example):**
    ```bash
    # Ensure pytest and pytest-cov are installed (they are in requirements.txt)
    # From the project root directory (devops_sentry_risk_assessor) with .venv active:
    pytest
    # For coverage:
    # pytest --cov=agent_core --cov-report=html
    ```

## 8. Verification Steps

1.  Ensure the CLI installs correctly: `pip install -e .` runs without errors.
2.  Run `sentry-cli --version` and `sentry-cli --help` to verify basic CLI functionality.
3.  Run `sentry-cli analyze` with mock paths (or real paths once analyzers are built) and verify it produces output (even if mock output initially).
4.  As you build analyzers, verify their specific outputs against known good/bad code/IaC samples.

## 9. Tear Down / Cleanup

-   **Deactivate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
-   **Uninstall the CLI Tool:**
    If installed with `pip install -e .` from within the project directory:
    ```bash
    pip uninstall devops_sentry_risk_assessor
    ```
    (You might need to confirm with 'y'.)
-   **Delete Project Directory:**
    Manually delete the root project directory (`devops_sentry_risk_assessor`).
-   **Delete Virtual Environment:**
    Manually delete the `.venv` directory.

## 10. Assumptions Made (by this setup script and initial README)

-   The user has Python 3.8+, `pip`, and `bash` installed and operational.
-   The initial focus is on creating the project structure and a basic CLI. The core AI/LLM-driven analysis logic within `agent_core` needs to be implemented.
-   Secure handling of API keys (for LLMs or cloud providers) will be implemented by the developer (e.g., using environment variables, `.env` files not committed to git, or a secrets management system).
-   The user understands that the initial `sentry_cli.py` contains placeholder logic for analysis and reporting.

This README provides a foundational structure. It should be expanded significantly as the agent's capabilities are developed.
